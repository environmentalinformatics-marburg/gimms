Description: This is a set of functions to retrieve information about GIMMS
    NDVI3g files currently available online; download (and re-arrange, in the case
    of NDVI3g.v0) the half-monthly data sets; import downloaded files from ENVI
    binary (NDVI3g.v0) or NetCDF format (NDVI3g.v1) directly into R based on the
    widespread 'raster' package; conduct quality control; and generate monthly
    composites (e.g., maximum values) from the half-monthly input data. As a special
    gimmick, a method is included to conveniently apply the Mann-Kendall trend test
    upon 'Raster*' images, optionally featuring trend-free pre-whitening to account
    for lag-1 autocorrelation.
