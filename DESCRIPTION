Description: We provide a set of functions to retrieve information about GIMMS
    NDVI3g files currently available online; download and re-arrange the bi-monthly
    datasets according to creation time; import downloaded files from native binary
    (ENVI) format directly into R based on the widely applied 'raster' package;
    calculate monthly value composites (e.g. maximum value composites, MVC) from the
    bi-monthly input data; and derive long-term monotonous trends from the
    Mann-Kendall trend test, optionally featuring pre-whitening to
    account for lag-1 autocorrelation.
