Description: This is a set of functions to retrieve information about GIMMS
    NDVI3g files currently available online; download (and re-arrange, in the 
    case of NDVI3g.v0) the half-monthly data sets from 
    <https://ecocast.arc.nasa.gov/data/pub/gimms/>; import downloaded files from 
    ENVI binary (NDVI3g.v0) or NetCDF format (NDVI3g.v1) directly into R based 
    on the widespread 'raster' package; conduct quality control; and generate 
    monthly composites (e.g., maximum values) from the half-monthly input data. 
    As a special gimmick, a method is included to conveniently apply the 
    Mann-Kendall trend test upon 'Raster*' images, optionally featuring 
    trend-free pre-whitening to account for lag-1 autocorrelation.
