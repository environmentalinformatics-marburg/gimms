Description:
    We provide a set of functions to retrieve information about GIMMS NDVI3g
    files currently available online; download and re-arrange the bi-monthly
    datasets according to creation time; import downloaded files from native
    binary (ENVI) format directly into R based on the widely applied 'raster'
    package; and calculate monthly value composites (e.g. maximum value
    composites, MVC) from the bi-monthly input data.
