gimms 0.5.0 (2016-01-15)

* Added parallel support to downloadGimms, rasterizeGimms and monthlyComposite.
* Revised package documentation.


gimms 1.0.0 (2016-11-28)
==============

Changes:

* Added support for the recently released NDVI3g.v1 to all package functions.
* Included local file inventories for all available GIMMS products (NDVI3g.v0
  and NDVI3g.v1) and their respective servers (ECOCAST, NASANEX).
* Quality control has been added to rasterizeGimms() through specifying
  permitted flag values ('keep'), rendering the subsequent application of a
  separate function unnecessary. For reasons of convenience, however,
  qualityControl() is still available.
* rasterizeGimms() now includes an extent argument ('ext') to enable clipping
  based on raster::crop().
* Scaling and the rejection of water and nodata-mask values are no longer
  optional.
* If 'timestamp = TRUE', monthlyIndices() now returns an object of class 'Date'
  (instead of 'character') and '...' is no longer available.
