gimms 1.0.0 (2016-11-11)
==============

Changes:

* Enabled optional creation of target folder during file download.
* Added 'version' argument to updateInventory and downloadGimms in order to
  support the recently updated GIMMS version 1 (until end 2015, .nc4 files).
* Included local file inventories for all servers (ECOCAST, NASANEX) and product
  versions (0 and 1) available.
* If 'timestamp = TRUE', monthlyIndices() returns a 'Date' object (i.e., '...'
  is no longer available).
* rasterizeGimms() now includes an extent argument ('ext') to enable clipping
  based on raster::crop().

To do:

* validServer, validVersion
* valid list passed to qualityControl()
* qualityControl(), flexibly adjust 'keep' according to 'version'; names() of
  resultant 'RasterStack'
* counter function for getNDVILayers()
* rearrangeFiles for version 0 only
* getProduct() in monthlyIndices()?
* GitHub Readme header similar to mapview
* checkFilename (e.g., qualityControl, length 1 or length(x) allowed)
