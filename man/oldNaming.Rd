\title{Create Traditional GIMMS NDVI3g File Names}
\usage{
oldNaming(x, suffix = "")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{character}. GIMMS NDVI3g.v1 file names to reformat, see
'Details'.}

\item{suffix}{\code{character}. Optional suffix to append to the resulting
file names, e.g. \code{".tif"} for GeoTiff files (see also
\code{\link[raster]{writeFormats}}).}
}
\value{
A \code{character} vector of file names following the "traditional" NDVI3g.v0
naming convention.
}
\description{
Reformat the names of local NDVI3g.v1 files according to "traditional"
NDVI3g.v0 naming convention.
}
\details{
The satellite number, which was an essential constituent of the NDVI3g.v0
file naming convention (see 'References'), has been removed from NDVI3g.v1
file names. However, it can easily be accessed via \code{\link[ncdf4]{ncvar_get}}
given that the file has previously been downloaded. If an NDVI3g.v1 file
specified to 'x' is not available locally, by contrast, the satellite number
is retrieved from the built-in NDVI3g.v0 file inventory (until end 2013; see
'Examples') and newer files are tagged with \code{"XX"} indicating missing
information.
}
\examples{
fls <- system.file("extdata", "inventory_ecv1.rds", package = "gimms")
fls <- basename(readRDS(fls))

oldNaming(fls[64:65], suffix = ".tif") # adds .tif extension
oldNaming(fls[65:66])                  # tags newer files with 'XX'
